    <h4>Installation</h4>
    <p>
      You'll need a Foundry VTT License or GM access to a Foundry VTT
      server.
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Launch Foundry VTT.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to Game Systems, Install System.
      </li>
      <li>
        Search for 'Old-School Essentials' or 'ose' and click the Install button.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally install the free, community-created
        <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/classicfantasycompendium" target="_blank">Classic Fantasy
          Compendium</a>
        or the <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ose-advancedfantasytome" target="_blank">Advanced Fantasy</a>
        premium content module. You do not need both (or either).
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new game world, selecting Old-School Essentials from the game system
        dropdown menu.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Setup</h4>
    <p>You can find game system settings by navigating to the Settings Directory
      (the gears icon), clicking the Configure Settings button, and clicking
      Old-School Essentials in the dialog box.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/settings.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      These are several settings to customize your experience with Old
      School Essentials.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initiative</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Group initiative:</strong> every combatant in the same group
            will have the same initiative roll result (but their final initiative
            may be modified by abilities).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Individual initiative:</strong> every combatant will have its
            own initiative roll. Characters will show an initiative modifier on
            their character sheets, see the <a href="#character-attributes">Attributes</a> section.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Initiative persistence:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keep each round:</strong> initiative is automatically rolled
            at the beginning of each combat, and the number does not change between rounds.
            Any initiative already rolled at the beginning of combat will be retained.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Reset each round:</strong> initiative result is removed at the beginning
            of each round and not automatically re-rolled. Players will have to click to roll
            new initiative.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Reroll each round:</strong> initiative is automatically rolled
            at the beginning of each round.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ascending Armor Class:</strong> By default, Old-School Essentials
        uses the original descending Armor Class and the 'To Hit Armour Class 0' attack
        statistic, also known as THAC0. When checked, this setting will use the optional
        rules for AAC and AB (attack bonus) given in Old-School Essentials.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Monster Morale:</strong> This enables the optional rule for Monster Morale
        from Old-School Essentials. Record and roll a Morale check to see
        whether a monster decides to flee under perilous conditions.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Encumbrance:</strong> The weight of items a character carries may
        modify their movement rate. The modified movement rate for each encumbrance threshold
        is documented in the Old-School Essential rules.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Disabled:</strong> You can disable the effect of
            weight and armor on movement.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Basic:</strong> Movement is calculated from the
            armour type and whether you are carrying more than
            "significant" treasure.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Detailed:</strong> If the character carries any "adventuring gear,"
            80 coins of weight will be added to the character's total encumbrance.
            The weight of other equipment is counted individually.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Complete:</strong> Each and every item, including adventuring gear,
            will count towards a character's encumbrance.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Item-based:</strong> Items are generally counted as one unit of weight,
            but two-handed items are counted as two units, and small items are not encumbering.
            Refer to <a href="https://necroticgnome.com/products/carcass-crawler-issue-2" target="_blank">Carcass
              Crawler Issue Two</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Significant treasure weight:</strong> If you have the
        Basic encumbrance option enabled, the movement rate will depend on
        a predefined weight at which you consider the treasure to be
        cumbersome. You can set the value here and it will be used to
        determine the movement rates of characters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Languages:</strong> Characters and monsters can select
        languages they speak from a list given here. Classic Fantasy compendium
        languages are already included by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Token Damage Target:</strong> Chat cards will ask the user whether
        their successful attack will deal damage. This setting affects which type
        of targeting system they'd like to use.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Selected:</strong> The selected token receives the damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Target:</strong> The currently targeted token receives the damage
            (even if it wasn't the target when the attack was rolled).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Original Target:</strong> The token that was targeted when the
            attack was rolled receives the damage (even if a different token is targeted when
            the damage button is pushed).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Invert Ctrl/Meta Key behavior:</strong> Many of the game system's automated
        dice rolls will show a dialog box to input modifiers to the dice roll by default, but this
        dialog box can be skipped by holding Ctrl (on Windows) or Meta (on Mac). Checking this box
        will make the dialog boxes skip automatically, but show when the Ctrl/Meta key is held down.
      </li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spellcaster:</strong> Shows the Magic tab (even if the Actor doesn't
            have any spells).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Retainer:</strong> Adds the Loyalty rating and Wage attributes to a character,
            removes the Title and Next Level XP attributes.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Don't apply weapon bonus to damage roll:</strong> A weapon's bonus (e.g. +1, +2)
            will only augment the attack of the weapon. You may use this to write your damage bonus in
            the damage input box instead.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Initiative Bonus:</strong> Will add this value to
            initiative in addition to the Dexterity modifier.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Next Level:</strong> The threshold at which the

        <li><strong>Experience share:</strong> The share of the party
          XP you will get from the experience dealt (e.g. 50% for Retainers).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Melee Bonus:</strong> A bonus to the Attack roll
          only for melee weapons, in addition to other modifiers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Missile Bonus:</strong> A bonus to the Attack roll
          only for missile weapons, in addition to other modifiers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Armor Class:</strong> This value will be added

        </li>
        <li><strong>Encumbrance:</strong> (GM Only) The maximum value at

          "half-encumbered" will now be 900 instead of the default 800.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate movement:</strong> (GM Only) uncheck this box to manually

    <h6 class="docs-header">Header</h6>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/header.png" />
    </p>
    <p>The Character sheet header contains text fields you can edit
      directly. There is no automation done with the header fields.</p>
    <p>The greyed text on top of the experience field is the XP prime
      requisites bonus that can be set in the Tweaks dialog box. It is used
      when experience is dealt automatically via the party sheet.</p>
    <p> If the character survives long enough, the Level field will
      glow as soon when the character has enough experience to level up.
      This experience threshold is also set in the Tweaks dialog box.
    </p>
    <h6 id="character-attributes" class="docs-header">Combat</h6>
    <p>The Default tab is dedicated to the combat statistics of the actor.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/attributes.png" />
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Ability Scores</h4>
    <p>The left side of this view is dedicated to the ability scores. You can edit these
      values directly, but they can also be automatically generated using the character
      generator dialog box.</p>
    <p>Ability rolls can be made by clicking on the attribute name. After
      clicking you will see a dialog where you can input modifiers. If
      you try to roll the attributes will holding the CTRL key, the
      dialog will be skipped.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/attribute-roll.png" />
    </p>
    <p>By hovering your cursor over the character portrait,
      you can click on the book icon to see the influence of each ability score on the
      other stats of your character. That will be useful during character creation, but also
      to see other stats like your maximum number of retainers, or
      literacy.</p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Resources and secondary attributes</h4>
    <p>The center of this view is dedicated to resources and secondary attributes.</p>
    <p>THAC0 or Attack Bonus (AB) will show inside a morningstar weapon, depending on whether
      the Ascending Armour Class optional rule is enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hit points current and max values will show inside the winged heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armour Class (normal or ascending) will appear inside the shield.
      If there is a small shield icon on top of the Armor class
      value, it means you have a shield equipped that should not be
      taken into account when you are attacked from behind.
    </p>
    <p>On the second row are the Melee, ranged, and initiative modifiers for
      the character.</p>
    <p>The third row details the movement rates for different situations, i.e. Encounter movement
      per round, Exploration movement per dungeon turn, and Overland movement per day. These are automatically
      set based on your encumbrance setting and weight.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/attack-roll.png" />
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Saving Throws</h4>
    <p>
      On the right side of this view, the saving throws for the character may
      be recorded. Complete names and abbreviations for each can be seen on hover.
      This can be rolled when the save name is clicked, and can be speedrolled with Ctrl/Meta
      as well.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/save-roll.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The bonus versus magic is applied by clicking the Vs Magic button in the dialog box
      when a save is clicked. This means saves vs magic cannot be "speedrolled."
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Skills and Abilities</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/abilities.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The top row contains rollable entries for exploration rolls.
      These can be speed rolled with Ctrl/Meta.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the abilities section you can create anything that needs a
      description. It can be thieves' skills, class abilities, and so on.
      You can create a new ability by clicking the plus button or by
      dragging one from the item sidebar or a compendium.
      You can open the abilities with the pen icon, show it in the chat
      with the eye icon, and delete it with the trash icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also drag skills onto the character sheet from a compendium.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/ability.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      When opened, the ability details can be entered. On the left you can set the
      ability requirements, for example `Thief, 1`, and you can enter a roll associated
      with the ability. For example if Roll is `1d100`, roll type is `>=` and target is
      `40`. The roll will display success in green as if the result is above 40.
      When the ability has a roll set you can click on the ability image
      on the character sheet to roll directly to the chat.
      You can apply the roll result as damage or as healing by right
      clicking on the chat card, this is true for all rolls.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/ability-chat.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need someone else to roll an ability you can show the
      whole ability to the chat with the eye icon and they can roll from
      there. They can also roll a save for that ability.
      Note that you can slide down the ability description by clicking
      on its name from the character sheet.
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Spells</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/spells.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      You won't have this tab displayed by default. You must enable the
      `spellcaster` checkbox in the Tweaks dialog located in the sheet
      toolbar, or drag a magic item into the character sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here you can record your spellbook contents, or your deity's available spells.
      First you can add a new spell by clicking the plus. For each level of spell you have,
      you will have a new section for its level with it's related spell slot counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning I recommend creating one New Spell for each spell
      level you have and then change their level by opening them, which
      unlocks the spell slot counters for each level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spell slot counters have two values. The first one is the number
      of spells you have memorized, which can't be edited. The second
      is the total number of spell slots you have. Edit this value as
      the character levels up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spells themselves have counters. The first is the remaining
      available spells, the second is the number of this spell you
      memorized. The spell counter decreases as you roll
      them by clicking their image. Used spell slots can be refreshed
      by clicking the reset icon in the spells tab header.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/spell.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Spells are similar to abilities but have a few more info. Rolls
      can't be configured as much, you can only set a roll string.
      However you can still specify a Save so when the Spell is displayed on
      chat with the eye icon, a button that triggers a save roll from
      the selected actors is displayed below the spell description.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/spell-card.png" />
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Inventory</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/inventory.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The inventory compiles every item you own, from weapons to
      treasure. Weapons are in the first section. Clicking on the weapon
      icon will roll an attack with damage.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/item-attack.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Damage rolled during the attack can be applied to one or several
      selected tokens if you click on the blood drop icon right to the
      result. You can apply damage or healing by right clicking on the
      chat card, which is true for all rolls. Damage will be applied
      according to the damage application setting in Configure Settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking on the name will expand the item description along with
      relevant tags, including damage.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/item-collapse.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to equip an item. Equipped slow weapons will make the character
      last in the initiative order. Some special tags are displayed as icons in the inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you open the weapon sheet by clicking on the pen icon, you
      can edit the stats and add new tags. The Melee and Missile icons, when clicked, will make
      the weapon use your character's melee or missile modifiers. If both are active,
      the system will prompt the userwhether the weapon is being held or thrown when attacking.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/weapon.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add new weapon tags if you type text in the field below the weapon
      icon and press ENTER. If you enter more than one, the input
      parser will split tags using commas. Text entered between brackets will be visible when
      hovered by the cursor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armour has a configurable Armour Class and an Armour type,
      Misc items can have a quantity directly editable from the inventory list.
      If checked as Treasure, it is displayed under the treasure header instead and will
      usually count against one's encumbrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the inventory view is the encumbrance bar.
      Weight, visualized here as a percentage with thresholds and a maximum,
      is used for automatic mouvement calculation. Your encumbrance max value
      is 1600 by default, and at each threshold shown, the character's movement will degrade.

    <h4 class="docs-header">Notes</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/notes.png" />
    </p>
    <p>This tab is a free space you can record description and notes.
      This is enriched so you can use inline rolls, entity links and
      anything you can usually do in a journal entry.</p>
    <p>You can add known language by clicking on the plus next to the
      language header. The number of languages you can speak can be found
      in the View Modifiers dialog box.</p>

    <h4>Monsters</h4>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Tweaks</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/monster-tweaks.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The options available in the monster tweaks menu is mostly a subset of the character
      tweaks menu. But one new feature is the ability to enable an inventory tab for this monster.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spellcaster:</strong> Shows the Magic tab (even if the Actor doesn't
        have any spells).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Retainer:</strong> Adds the Loyalty rating and Wage attributes to a character,
        removes the Title and Next Level XP attributes.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Don't apply weapon bonus to damage roll:</strong> A weapon's bonus (e.g. +1, +2)
        will only augment the attack of the weapon. You may use this to write your damage bonus in
        the damage input box instead.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Initiative Bonus:</strong> Will add this value to
        initiative in addition to the Dexterity modifier.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Enable inventory:</strong> See the same inventory tab as characters have.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Header</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/monster-header.png" />
    </p>
    <p>The first row below the name contains rollable fields.
      The alignment roll icon rolls a plain 2d6 on the
      reaction table. Numb appearing (NA) can be rolled and
      morale (optional) as well. XP award is just plain text.</p>
    <p>The Treasure type can show a link to a rollable table. You may drop a
      rollable table onto a monster sheet to show it here. Right clicking the
      treasure table link removes it.
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Abilities</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/monster-abilities.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Hit Points can be silently rolled as you click the dice icon
      next to it. Hit dice must be a rollable string.
      AC (or AAC) is manually typed here. Clicking on THAC0 (or AB) will
      launch an unarmed attack for 1d6 damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abilities and equipment panel will contain the heart and
      soul of your monster. You can set clickable abilities just like for
      characters. There is also a weapon counter so the referee knows how many
      attacks were made each round. The counters may be reset with the
      reset icon in the header.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left of the weapon icons, in the list, you can mark an
      item with a color so you can distinguish and fuse attacks into attack patterns.
      In the example here, the red attack pattern is 2 x Claws and 1x Bite, and in green
      is a 1 x tail spike attack.
    </p>
    <p>You can record movement details for non-walking movement options
      your monster may have. Below that, the monster's saves, which can
      be speedrolled with CTRL held down.</p>
    <p>
      Monsters use the same tabs as characters for spells, weapons
      and items. The Notes tab is only a large text editor where you can
      input the monster description or any other particularities that
      does not fit on the sheet itself.

  <div id="initiative" class="docs-section">
    <h4>Initiative</h4>
    <p style="float: right;">
      <img src="./images/initiative-result.png" />
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header">Grouped initiative</h4>
    <p>
      By default each character or creature is assigned to a group. If
      their disposition is hostile in the Token configuration they will by default
      be in the 'Red' group. Neutral is purple, and Friendly is green. But the
      GM can change the group for each combatant by clicking on the flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters equipped with a Slow weapon have a Weight icon displayed in place of the initiative
      value. If they unequip the weapon they can reset their initiative to the group value by re-adding them
      to the combat encounter.
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-header" style="clear: right;">Individual initiative and initiative controls</h4>
    <p style="float: right;">
      <img src="./images/initiative-individual.png" />
    </p>
    <p>Individual initiative combat is exactly the same as the default Foundry VTT experience.
      I invite readers to check out <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/kb/" target="_blank">Foundry VTT's knowledge
        base</a>, keeping in mind
      that your "Reroll initiative" setting may modify the default rerolling behaviour.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="treasure" class="docs-section" style="clear: right;">
    <h4>Treasure tables</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/treasure-sidebar.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The default rollable table behavior does not support treasure tables,
      so one must use the treasure table toggle to create a new treasure table.
      It's the icon that looks like a treasure chest.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/treasure-toggle.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      You can toggle between the default rollable tables and the
      treasure table with the Chest icon right next to the table name.
      Once enabled, each entry is rolled with 1d100 and the value
      is compared to the 'chance field'. This allows it to return multiple
      items.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/treasure-table.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Foundry VTT allows rollable tables to be filled with enriched
      Text, Entities like journals and items and compendium objects.
      You can even add a treasure table to a treasure table, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon rolling a treasure table, the result is displayed in the
      chat.

  <div id="party" class="docs-section">
    <h4>Party Overview</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/party-sidebar.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      A party icon in the Actors Directory, next to the
      search filter, will open the Party Overview sheet.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/party-overview.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Party Sheet condenses a lot of stats about your
      group. To add members to the party, simply drag and drop actors
      (or folders of actors) from the sidebar into the Party window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every info icon on the Sheet will display its name when hovered by the cursor.
      If you hover on the actor image you will see two buttons: one
      that opens up the corresponding actor sheet, and another that removes the
      actor from the party sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XP button in the window header allows you to deal
      experience to the characters in the party. This will take into
      account the experience Share set in the Characters <a href="#tweaks">Tweaks</a> dialog.
      After shares are calculated, each actor will send a message to the chat telling how many
      experience points they get after applying their share and their
      experience bonus.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="./images/party-xp-overview.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't forget to set the experience share to 50% for retainers!
